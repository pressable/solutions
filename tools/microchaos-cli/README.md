# ⚡️ MicroChaos CLI Load Tester

v4.2.0 — "Overlap"

Welcome to **MicroChaos**—a precision-built WP-CLI load testing tool forged in the fires of real-world WordPress hosting constraints.

When external load testing tools are blocked, when rate limits make your bots cry, and when SSH feels like a locked door... **MicroChaos lets you stress test like a ninja from the inside.**

Built for staging environments like **Pressable**, MicroChaos simulates traffic at scale—warm or cold cache, anonymous or authenticated, fast bursts or slow burns.

## Current Bugs

*No known bugs at this time.*

## 🆕 What's New in v4.2.0 "Overlap"

v4.1.0 told the truth about what one process can measure: `--burst` is pacing,
and a single WP-CLI process fires requests one at a time. That is still true,
and it is still the sizing input.

v4.2.0 adds the overlap run that v3 removed for the wrong mechanism. The old
`--concurrency` was curl_multi inside one process; Pressable loopback serializes
that. The new `--concurrency=N` launches N sequential `loadtest` processes at
the same instant — the method that produced real overlap on Pressable (cache
stampede races, HIT/regen splits on an already-warm URL).

- **`--concurrency=N`** (default 1, cap 8). `--count` and `--duration` are per
  process. `--count=1 --concurrency=4` is a four-request stampede.
- **`--results-json=<path>`** so workers can hand results back without
  interleaving summaries. The parent prints one merged report.
- Combined Throughput from an overlap run is **not** a Phase 4 RPS. Size on a
  sequential `--cache-bust` run. The summary says so.
- Sequential default is unchanged. Existing 4.1.0 commands keep their numbers.

## 🆕 What's New in v4.1.0 "Ground Truth"

v4.1.0 is a correctness release. Every change below fixes a case where MicroChaos
reported a number that looked plausible and was wrong, so **results from 4.1.0 are not
comparable with results from earlier builds.** Re-baseline any site you are tracking.

- **Authenticated tests are actually authenticated.** Auth cookies are now built
  directly instead of via `wp_set_auth_cookie()`, which is a no-op under WP-CLI. Prior
  "logged-in" runs were measuring anonymous, often cached, traffic.
- **Cache hit/miss ratios count every request.** Header collection previously recorded
  each distinct value once per burst instead of accumulating counts.
- **`--cache-bust` flag** for measuring origin performance rather than edge cache.
- **Resource output is labelled as the load generator**, not the site under test. Adds
  generator CPU in cores so you can subtract it from host dashboard readings.
- **Redirects are no longer counted as errors.** 2xx and 3xx both count as success, and
  the summary now prints the full status code distribution.
- **`--timeout` flag**, defaulting to 30s instead of a hardcoded 10s. Timeouts are
  reported separately from connection errors, with a warning when timing data is
  right-censored.
- **Throughput is reported two ways**: wall-clock RPS (pair this with dashboard CPU) and
  the serial ceiling (the site's intrinsic single-worker throughput). Capacity
  projections are based on the ceiling and labelled accordingly.
- **One version, one build.** The plugin header is the single source of truth, the build
  is reproducible, and CI fails if `dist/` drifts from source.

## 🆕 What's New in v4.0.0 "The Headless Horseman"

v4.0.0 brings **first-class headless WordPress support** for testing GraphQL endpoints.

### Headless WordPress Testing

- **`--graphql` shorthand** - Sets method=POST and endpoint=/graphql automatically
- **`--user-agent` flag** - Custom User-Agent for Pressable headless apps
- **GraphQL error detection** - Automatically detects errors in 200 OK responses
- **Comprehensive guide** - Full workflow for headless WordPress capacity planning

### New Output

Per-request GraphQL error reporting:
```
-> 200 in 0.45s [GQL errors: 1]
```

Summary with GraphQL error tracking:
```
Success: 95 | HTTP Errors: 0 | GraphQL Errors: 5 | Error Rate: 5%
```

### Why "The Headless Horseman"?

Because testing a headless site without proper load testing is like Ichabod Crane riding through Sleepy Hollow without a lantern. MicroChaos is your lantern.

---

## 📜 What's New in v3.0.0

### Simplified & Focused

v3.0.0 is a **radical simplification**. We removed features that didn't work reliably on Pressable (parallel testing, progressive mode) and focused on what actually delivers value:

- **52% smaller codebase** - Removed 2,590 lines of non-functional code
- **Single command** - `wp microchaos loadtest` does everything
- **Serial execution optimized** - Works perfectly within Pressable's loopback rate limits

### New Features

- **Execution Metrics** - Every test now reports:
  - Wall-clock throughput, and the serial ceiling it should be read against
  - Single-worker capacity projections (hourly/daily/monthly)
  - Test timestamps (human-readable + ISO 8601)
  - Total duration with formatted display

### Under the Hood

- **100% type hints** - All public methods have PHP 8.2+ type declarations
- **Testable architecture** - Logger interface enables unit testing without WordPress
- **61 unit tests** - Core components tested in 14ms without WordPress runtime
- **Clean separation** - Thin CLI wrapper (63 lines) + LoadTestOrchestrator (656 lines)

### Removed Features

These features were removed because they don't work on Pressable due to loopback rate limiting:

- ❌ `wp microchaos parallel` - Parallel test execution (one-process curl_multi)
- ❌ `wp microchaos progressive` - Progressive load testing
- ❌ `--concurrency` flag as curl_multi-in-one-process (did not overlap on Pressable)

v4.2.0 brings `--concurrency` back as **process fan-out**, which is a different
mechanism and the one that actually overlaps on this platform. External tools
(k6, Artillery) remain the right choice for hundreds of VUs from outside the
container.

---

## 📦 Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Copy the file `microchaos-cli.php` from the `dist` directory to `wp-content/mu-plugins/` on your site.
2. Make sure WP-CLI is available in your environment.
3. You're ready to chaos!

---

## 🚨 Platform Considerations (Pressable & Managed Hosts)

MicroChaos is built specifically for **Pressable** and similar managed WordPress hosts where loopback requests are rate-limited (~10 concurrent max). The default path is still **serial execution** inside one process. `--concurrency=N` overlaps by launching N of those serial processes; stay at or under 8, and treat 4 as the starting point on a 5-worker staging box.

### Understanding the `--burst` Flag

The `--burst` flag controls how many **sequential** requests fire before pausing (via `--delay`). This is NOT concurrency—it's throughput control.

**Choosing burst values:**

| Site Speed | Recommended Burst | Reasoning |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Fast (<100ms) | 200-500 | High throughput, quick completion |
| Medium (100-500ms) | 50-200 | Balance throughput vs duration |
| Slow (>500ms) | 20-50 | Avoid duration overshoot |

**⚠️ Duration Overshoot Warning:** In duration-based tests (`--duration=X`), the current burst always completes before the test stops. A 1-minute test with `--burst=500` on a slow site (1s per request) could run 8+ minutes. Start conservative, scale up.

### Understanding the `--timeout` Flag

Requests are abandoned after `--timeout` seconds (default 30). Raise it when testing something you expect to be slow.

This matters more than a timeout usually does, because an abandoned request is not recorded as slow — it is recorded as an error and leaves the timing distribution entirely. So a cutoff set below what the site actually produces makes average and maximum response time *improve* as the site degrades, while the error rate climbs for a reason that reads as "broken" rather than "slow". Those point at different fixes.

MicroChaos warns when any request hits the cutoff, since the timings printed above it are then conditional on the requests that finished. Treat that warning as a signal to re-run with a higher `--timeout` before drawing conclusions about the tail.

### The Essential Flag Combo

For capacity planning, always combine these three:

```bash
--resource-logging --resource-trends --cache-headers
```

- **resource-logging**: Resource usage of the **load generator** — the WP-CLI process
  sending the requests, not the PHP-FPM worker serving them. Its memory tells you
  nothing about the site, so size worker RAM from your host's metrics instead. Its
  derived CPU figure *is* worth having: the generator runs on the same container as
  the site, so subtract it from any per-site CPU reading taken during the test
  before dividing throughput by CPU.
- **resource-trends**: The generator's usage over the run. It will not find a leak in
  the site — the generator's own memory grows with test duration because it
  accumulates results as it goes.
- **cache-headers**: Pressable cache behavior (x-ac, x-nananana)

---

## 📊 Capacity Planning Guide

This is how MicroChaos is actually used for Pressable capacity audits.

### The 3-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 1: Baseline Discovery

Establish how the site performs under known conditions:

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=5 --burst=50 \
  --warm-cache --resource-logging --cache-headers \
  --save-baseline=initial
```

**What you're measuring:** Warm cache response times, baseline memory usage, cache hit rates.

#### Phase 2: Sustained Load Testing

Simulate realistic traffic over time to find degradation:

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=10 --burst=100 \
  --resource-logging --resource-trends --cache-headers
```

**What you're looking for:**
- Does RPS stay stable or decline?
- Does memory climb (leak) or stay flat?
- What's the cache HIT/MISS ratio under load?

#### Phase 3: Multi-Endpoint Rotation

Test realistic user flows across the site:

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoints=home,shop,cart,checkout \
  --duration=10 --burst=100 --rotation-mode=serial \
  --resource-logging --resource-trends --cache-headers
```

**Why this matters:** Single-endpoint tests miss bottlenecks. Real users hit multiple paths, triggering different code, queries, and cache patterns.

### Interpreting Results

#### Execution Metrics (Capacity)

Two throughput numbers are reported, and they answer different questions:

```
Throughput: 4.74 req/s (wall clock, includes --delay pacing)
Serial ceiling: 8.31 req/s (response time only — what one request at a time costs)
  43.0% of the run was pacing and overhead, not waiting on responses.

Single-Worker Capacity (projected from the serial ceiling):
  Per hour: 29,916 | Per day: 717,984 | Per month: ~21.5M
```

**Throughput** is requests divided by wall-clock time, so it counts the `--delay` sleeps between bursts as though they were work. Change `--delay` or `--burst` and this number changes while the site does not. It is *not* a capacity limit. Its one real use is pairing with a host CPU reading, which covers the same window.

**Serial ceiling** divides by time actually spent waiting on responses. That is what one request at a time costs this site, independent of how you paced the run, and it is the figure to compare across runs and across dates.

**Decision logic:**
- Read per-request cost from the serial ceiling, never from wall-clock throughput. A low wall-clock number usually means you paced conservatively, not that the site is slow.
- Treat single-worker capacity as a **sizing input, not a capacity estimate**. It assumes one worker, back-to-back requests, no cache hits and no idle time — so it is a floor for a single worker, not a ceiling for the site. Real capacity scales with worker count and cache hit rate.
- If the pacing share is high, the run spent most of its time asleep. That is fine for a soak test, but do not read the wall-clock figure as a limit.

#### Resource Trends (Stability)

```
Memory Trend: ↑12.3% over test duration
Pattern: Moderate growth
```

| Trend | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Flat (±5%) | Stable, safe for sustained load | ✅ Good to go |
| Climbing (5-15%) | Possible leak or buffer growth | ⚠️ Investigate plugins |
| Steep climb (>15%) | Memory leak, will eventually crash | 🚨 Fix before scaling |

#### Cache Headers (Efficiency)

```
Edge Cache (x-ac): HIT 20% | STALE 50% | UPDATING 30%
Batcache (x-nananana): HIT 40% | MISS 60%
```

| Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| High HIT % | Cache working well | ✅ Efficient |
| High STALE % | Cache invalidating too often | Check invalidation logic |
| High MISS % | Database getting hammered | Review caching strategy |

### Common Audit Scenarios

#### "Site is slow during peak hours"

```bash
# Warm cache baseline
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=5 --burst=50 \
  --warm-cache --resource-logging --cache-headers --save-baseline=warm

# Cold cache comparison (worst case)
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=5 --burst=50 \
  --flush-between --resource-logging --cache-headers --compare-baseline=warm
```

**Look for:** Big gap between warm/cold = cache is critical. Small gap = cache isn't helping much.

#### "How many users can we handle?"

```bash
# Start conservative
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=5 --burst=50 \
  --resource-logging --auto-thresholds

# Scale up incrementally
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=10 --burst=100 \
  --resource-logging --use-thresholds=default

wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=10 --burst=200 \
  --resource-logging --use-thresholds=default
```

**Find the breaking point:** Where does RPS plateau? Where does memory peak? That's your capacity ceiling.

#### "WooCommerce checkout is slow"

```bash
# Test checkout as authenticated user
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=checkout --duration=10 --burst=50 \
  --auth=customer@example.com \
  --resource-logging --resource-trends --cache-headers --save-baseline=checkout

# Compare to homepage (same auth)
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=10 --burst=50 \
  --auth=customer@example.com \
  --resource-logging --compare-baseline=checkout
```

**Look for:** Checkout 5-10x slower than home = WooCommerce overhead, plugin hooks, or external API calls.

## 🤖 Headless WordPress Testing Guide

*"A headless site without load testing is like Ichabod Crane without a lantern—stumbling through Sleepy Hollow hoping the horseman doesn't catch you."*

MicroChaos v4.0.0 adds first-class support for **headless WordPress** load testing via GraphQL. This guide walks you through testing decoupled architectures where a frontend (Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby, etc.) consumes WordPress data via WPGraphQL.

### Prerequisites

Before running headless load tests, ensure:

| Requirement | How to Verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| **WPGraphQL installed** | `wp plugin list \| grep wp-graphql` or visit `/graphql` in browser |
| **MicroChaos deployed** | `wp microchaos --help` returns command info |
| **Test content exists** | Posts, pages, products—whatever your frontend queries |
| **SSH access** | You're running MicroChaos from inside WordPress via WP-CLI |

**For Pressable headless sites:**
- Custom User-Agent is **required** (format: `your-app-name/1.0`)
- Use the standard `/graphql` endpoint (rate limit exception exists)

### The 3-Phase Headless Workflow

#### Phase 1: Verify GraphQL is Working

Before load testing, confirm the endpoint responds correctly:

```bash
# Single request sanity check
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ __typename }"}' \
  --count=1
```

**Expected:** HTTP 200, no GraphQL errors. If you see `[GQL errors: 1]`, your query has issues.

#### Phase 2: Baseline Your Queries

Test your actual frontend queries under controlled conditions:

```bash
# Test your real query with resource monitoring
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts(first: 10) { nodes { id title slug content featuredImage { node { sourceUrl } } } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=my-frontend/1.0 \
  --count=50 --cache-headers --resource-logging \
  --save-baseline=posts-query
```

**What you're measuring:**
- Response times for your actual query complexity
- Memory usage on WordPress backend
- Cache behavior (POST = BYPASS, GET = cacheable)

#### Phase 3: Sustained Load Testing

Simulate real frontend traffic patterns:

```bash
# 10-minute sustained load test
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts(first: 10) { nodes { id title slug } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=my-frontend/1.0 \
  --duration=10 --burst=20 \
  --resource-logging --resource-trends --cache-headers
```

**What you're looking for:**
- Does RPS stay stable or decline over time?
- Does memory climb (potential leak) or stay flat?
- Are GraphQL errors appearing under load?

### JWT Authentication for Protected Queries

Many headless setups use JWT tokens for authenticated GraphQL queries. Here's the workflow:

#### Step 1: Get a JWT Token

Using WPGraphQL JWT Authentication plugin:

```bash
# Get token via mutation (run this manually first)
curl -X POST https://your-site.com/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { login(input: {username: \"admin\", password: \"password\"}) { authToken refreshToken } }"}'
```

Response:
```json
{"data":{"login":{"authToken":"eyJ0eXAi...","refreshToken":"..."}}}
```

#### Step 2: Use Token in MicroChaos

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ viewer { name email } }"}' \
  --header="Authorization=Bearer eyJ0eXAi..." \
  --user-agent=my-frontend/1.0 \
  --count=50
```

**Note:** JWT tokens expire. For long-duration tests, use a fresh token or test unauthenticated queries.

### Real-World Query Examples

#### Simple Post List (Blog Frontend)

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts(first: 10) { nodes { id title slug excerpt date } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=blog-frontend/1.0 \
  --count=100 --cache-headers
```

#### WooCommerce Products (E-commerce Frontend)

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ products(first: 20) { nodes { id name slug ... on SimpleProduct { price regularPrice } image { sourceUrl } } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=shop-frontend/1.0 \
  --count=100 --resource-logging
```

#### Complex Nested Query (Heavy Load)

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts(first: 5) { nodes { id title author { node { name posts(first: 3) { nodes { title } } } } categories { nodes { name posts(first: 3) { nodes { title } } } } } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=complex-frontend/1.0 \
  --count=50 --resource-logging --resource-trends
```

**Warning:** Deeply nested queries can be expensive. Watch memory usage carefully.

### Interpreting Headless Results

#### What "Good" Looks Like

| Metric | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **Response Time** | <200ms | 200-500ms | >500ms |
| **GraphQL Errors** | 0 | 1-5% | >5% |
| **Memory Growth** | Flat (±5%) | 5-15% climb | >15% climb |
| **Cache HITs (GET)** | >80% | 50-80% | <50% |

#### Red Flags to Watch For

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `[GQL errors: N]` appearing | Query syntax issue or schema mismatch | Fix query before load testing |
| Response times climbing over duration | Memory pressure or connection pooling | Check the host's own metrics — `--resource-trends` watches the generator, not the site |
| 100% BYPASS on all requests | Using POST (expected) or cache misconfigured | Use GET for cacheable queries |

### POST vs GET: Cache Strategy

**POST requests** (default with `--graphql`):
- Always bypass Pressable Edge Cache
- Every request hits PHP/WordPress
- Use for: mutations, authenticated queries, cache-busting tests

**GET requests** (with `--method=GET`):
- Can be cached by Edge Cache (with WPGraphQL Smart Cache)
- Cache HITs are ~30ms vs ~450ms uncached
- Use for: public queries, production traffic simulation

```bash
# Test cache effectiveness with GET
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql --method=GET \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts { nodes { title } } }"}' \
  --count=50 --cache-headers
```

**Look for:** First few requests MISS, then HITs. If all MISS, Smart Cache may not be configured.

### Pressable-Specific Considerations

1. **User-Agent Required**: Pressable headless apps need a custom UA for rate limit exceptions
2. **Standard `/graphql` Path**: Non-standard paths may be rate limited
3. **Edge Cache for GET**: Works with WPGraphQL Smart Cache plugin
4. **Loopback Limits**: MicroChaos uses serial requests (~10 concurrent max)

```bash
# Full Pressable headless test with all the trimmings
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts(first: 10) { nodes { title slug } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=my-nextjs-app/1.0 \
  --duration=5 --burst=50 \
  --resource-logging --resource-trends --cache-headers \
  --save-baseline=headless-baseline
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

MicroChaos features a modular component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns:

```text
microchaos/
├── bootstrap.php                    # Component loader (v3.0.0)
└── core/
    ├── interfaces/
    │   ├── logger.php               # Logger interface (testability)
    │   └── baseline-storage.php     # Storage abstraction
    ├── logging/
    │   ├── wp-cli-logger.php        # Production logger
    │   └── null-logger.php          # Test logger
    ├── storage/
    │   └── transient-baseline-storage.php
    ├── orchestrators/
    │   └── loadtest-orchestrator.php  # Test execution (656 lines)
    ├── commands.php                 # Thin WP-CLI wrapper (63 lines)
    ├── log.php                      # Static logger facade
    ├── constants.php                # Centralized constants
    ├── authentication-manager.php   # Auth utilities (8 static methods)
    ├── request-generator.php        # HTTP request management
    ├── cache-analyzer.php           # Cache header analysis
    ├── resource-monitor.php         # System resource tracking
    ├── reporting-engine.php         # Results and reporting
    ├── integration-logger.php       # External monitoring
    └── thresholds.php               # Thresholds and visualization
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Thin CLI wrapper**: `commands.php` is just 63 lines - all logic lives in `LoadTestOrchestrator`
- **Interface-based logging**: Swap `WP_CLI_Logger` for `Null_Logger` in tests
- **100% type hints**: All public methods have PHP 8.2+ type declarations
- **61 unit tests**: Pure PHP components tested without WordPress runtime

## 🔄 Build Process

MicroChaos uses a build system that compiles the modular version into a single-file distribution:

```text
build.js                   # Node.js build script
dist/                      # Generated distribution files
└── microchaos-cli.php     # Compiled single-file version (~123 KB)
```

### Building the Single-File Version

If you've made changes to the modular components and want to rebuild the single-file version:

```bash
# Make sure you have Node.js installed
node build.js
```

This will generate a fresh single-file version in the `dist/` directory, ready for distribution. The build script:

1. Extracts all component classes
2. Combines them into a single file
3. Maintains proper WP-CLI registration
4. Preserves backward compatibility

**Note**: Always develop in the modular version, then build for distribution. The single-file version is generated automatically and should not be edited directly.

---

## 🛠 Usage

1. Decide the real-world traffic scenario you need to test (e.g., 20 concurrent hits sustained, or a daily average of 30 hits/second at peak).
2. Run the loopback test with at least 2-3x those numbers to see if resource usage climbs to a point of concern.
3. Watch server-level metrics (PHP error logs, memory usage, CPU load) to see if you're hitting resource ceilings.

### Standard Load Testing

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=100
```

Or go wild:

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=checkout --count=50 --auth=admin@example.com --cache-headers --resource-logging
```

## 💡 Examples

### Load Testing Examples

Load test the homepage with cache warmup and log output

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=100 --warm-cache --log-to=uploads/home-log.txt
```

Four-request stampede (one request per process, launched together). Combined Throughput is not a sizing RPS.

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=custom:/fresh-page/ --count=1 --cache-bust --concurrency=4
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=1 --warm-cache --cache-headers --concurrency=4
```

Test multiple endpoints with random rotation

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoints=home,shop,cart,checkout --count=100 --rotation-mode=random
```

Add custom cookies to break caching

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=50 --cookie="session_id=123,test_variation=B"
```

Add custom HTTP headers to requests

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=50 --header="X-Test=true,Authorization=Bearer token123"
```

Simulate real users hitting checkout

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=checkout --count=25 --auth=admin@example.com
```

Hit a REST API endpoint with JSON from file

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=custom:/wp-json/api/v1/orders --method=POST --body=file:data/orders.json
```

Ramp-up traffic slowly over time

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=shop --count=100 --rampup
```

Save test results as a baseline for future comparison

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=100 --save-baseline=homepage
```

Compare with previously saved baseline

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=100 --compare-baseline=homepage
```

Run a test for a specific duration instead of request count

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=5 --burst=15 --resource-logging
```

Run a test with trend analysis to detect potential memory leaks

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --duration=10 --resource-logging --resource-trends
```

Auto-calibrate thresholds based on the site's current performance

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=50 --auto-thresholds
```

Run a test with previously calibrated thresholds

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=100 --use-thresholds=homepage
```

Run test with monitoring integration enabled for external metrics collection

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=50 --monitoring-integration

### Cache Header Analysis (Pressable)

Analyze Pressable's cache behavior with detailed per-request and summary reporting

```bash
wp microchaos loadtest --endpoint=home --count=50 --cache-headers --warm-cache
```

Example per-request output:
```
-> 200 in 0.032s [x-ac: 3.dca_atomic_dca STALE] [x-nananana: MISS]
-> 200 in 0.024s [x-ac: 3.dca_atomic_dca UPDATING] [x-nananana: HIT]
```

Example cache summary:
```
📦 Pressable Cache Header Summary:
   🌐 Edge Cache (x-ac):
     3.dca_atomic_dca STALE: 25 (50.0%)
     3.dca_atomic_dca UPDATING: 15 (30.0%)
     3.dca_atomic_dca HIT: 10 (20.0%)

   🦇 Batcache (x-nananana):
     MISS: 30 (60.0%)
     HIT: 20 (40.0%)
```

### GraphQL / Headless WordPress

Quick examples for headless WordPress testing. **See the full [Headless WordPress Testing Guide](#-headless-wordpress-testing-guide) for complete workflows, JWT authentication, and best practices.**

```bash
# Basic GraphQL test
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql --body='{"query":"{ posts { nodes { title } } }"}' --count=100

# With User-Agent (required for Pressable headless)
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql \
  --body='{"query":"{ posts { nodes { title } } }"}' \
  --user-agent=my-frontend/1.0 \
  --count=50 --cache-headers

# Cacheable GET query
wp microchaos loadtest --graphql --method=GET --count=50 --cache-headers
```

GraphQL errors are automatically detected—even in HTTP 200 responses:
```
-> 200 in 0.45s [GQL errors: 1]
Success: 0 | HTTP Errors: 0 | GraphQL Errors: 3 | Error Rate: 100%
```

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

"Improvisation > Perfection. Paradox is fuel."

Test sideways. Wear lab goggles. Hit the endpoints like they owe you money and answers.

- ⚡ Internal-only, real-world load generation
- 🧬 Built for performance discovery and observability
- 🤝 Friendly for TAMs, support engineers, and even devs ;)

## 🛠 Roadmap

### Phase 4: GraphQL & Headless WordPress ✅ Complete

MicroChaos now supports **GraphQL endpoint testing** for headless WordPress:

- ✅ **`--graphql` shorthand** - Sets method=POST and endpoint=/graphql automatically
- ✅ **`--user-agent` flag** - Custom User-Agent required for Pressable headless apps
- ✅ **Override support** - Combine with `--method=GET` for cacheable queries
- ✅ **Documented Pressable behavior** - POST=BYPASS, GET=cacheable
- ✅ **GraphQL error detection** - Automatically detect and report `errors` in GraphQL responses

### Future Ideas

- **Advanced visualizations** - Interactive charts for test results
- **Custom test templates** - Pre-configured plans for e-commerce, membership sites, etc.
- **Query complexity metrics** - Track resolver performance
